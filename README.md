# ConcurrencyCoursework

The goal of this project was to take an existing implementation of a problem and to modify it to run using concurrency in a thread safe manner. This project made use of the clang ThreadSanitizer to debug data race problems, ensuring the code continues to run as the number of threads are scaled.
